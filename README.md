# Data Structures Assignment using C++

Welcome to the Data Structures Assignment using C++ repository! This repository contains the assignment that my team and I are working on together in our faculty. The assignment involves implementing various data structures in C++. Below is an overview of the repository structure and contents.

## Repository Structure

#### The repository is structured as follows:

- **Assignment.pdf**: Contains the details and requirements of the assignment.
- **Assignment Solution/**: Contains all the files related to the implementation of the assignment.
  - `CMakeLists.txt`: Build configuration file for CMake.
  - **include/**: Directory containing header files for the data structures and other components.
    - `AVL.h`: Header file for the AVL tree implementation.
    - `BST.h`: Header file for the binary search tree implementation.
    - `Heap.h`: Header file for the heap implementation.
    - `Item.h`: Header file for the item class.
    - `MainIncludes.h`: Header file for main includes.
    - `Menu.h`: Header file for the menu system.
    - `TreeUtils.h`: Header file for tree utility functions.
  - `items.txt`: Text file containing item data used in the implementation.
  - **src/**: Directory containing source files for the data structures and other components.
    - `AVL.cpp`: Source file for the AVL tree implementation.
    - `BST.cpp`: Source file for the binary search tree implementation.
    - `Heap.cpp`: Source file for the heap implementation.
    - `Item.cpp`: Source file for the item class.
    - `main.cpp`: Source file containing the main function.
    - `Menu.cpp`: Source file for the menu system.
    - `TreeUtils.cpp`: Source file for tree utility functions.

## How to Build and Run
